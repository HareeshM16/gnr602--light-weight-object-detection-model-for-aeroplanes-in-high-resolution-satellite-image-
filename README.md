# GNR_602_Course_Project_Spring

# Objective: 
- Developed a lightweight object detection system to distinguish airplanes from non-airplane scenes in high-resolution satellite imagery, with golf courses treated as negative examples for binary classification.

# Flowchart 

1. Custom HOG Feature Extraction:

- Manually computed image gradients using the Sobel operator.
- Divided the image into 8×8 pixel cells.
- Calculated gradient orientation histograms for each cell based on magnitude and direction.
- Normalized histograms across larger blocks (e.g., 2×2 cells) to improve robustness to lighting and contrast changes.
- Focused on edge orientation and gradient structures to capture airplane characteristics.

2. Dataset and Labeling:

- Used patches from the UC Merced dataset.
- Labeled patches as airplane (positive) or golf course (negative) based on directory structure.

3. Classification Model:

- Trained a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) using sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.
- Choose Linear SVM for its effectiveness in high-dimensional, sparse feature spaces like those generated by HOG.

4. Detection Pipeline:

- Employed a sliding window approach on grayscale images (window size: 128×128 pixels, stride: 8 pixels).
- Extracted HOG features from each window and passed them to the trained SVM.
- Marked a window as a positive detection if the SVM confidence exceeded a threshold (e.g., 0.99).

5. Post-processing:
   
- Applied Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate overlapping detections.
- Retained only the highest confidence detection per region using an IoU threshold (e.g., 0.3).

6. Visualization & User Interaction:

- Built an interactive interface using Gradio.
- Enabled visual inspection of HOG features to understand classification decisions.

  # " **Instruction to see visualization of image** " 

  - To see the visualization, Please upload the (.tif) file in the user interface.
  - to visualize in kaggle give the path link of the image like this:  Load test image and detect
    test_img_path = "/kaggle/input/uc-merced-land-use-dataset/UCMerced_LandUse/Images/airplane/airplane28.tif"
  - try running the code in the Kaggle, since you will get the UC merced dataset there: /kaggle/input/uc-merced-land-use-dataset
  - and change the path in def main():
    dataset_dir = "/kaggle/input/uc-merced-land-use-dataset/UCMerced_LandUse/Images"
    print("Loading training data from UC Merced dataset...")
